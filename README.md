# About Me

This is Yu Bao (鲍宇). My name in Chinese Pinyin has two interesting extensions, one means rainstorm (🌧) and the other means abalone (🐟). I prefer the former one, looks very powerful. Actually, my name comes from "Staying together through thick and thin (fēng yǔ tóng zhōu)" because I also have an older brother named [Feng Bao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U0cuO94AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

I have been working as a research scientist at ByteDance Research since Apr. 2022. Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Nanjing University](https://grawww.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) in 2022. And I obtained a bachelor's degree from the School of Science of [Northeast Forestry University](https://www.nefu.edu.cn/) in 2015. <center><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?authuser=1&user=TqMb6nMAAAAJ">[Google Scholar]</a> <a href="mailto:nlp.baoy@gmail.com">[Email]</a> <a href="./files/baoy_CV.pdf">[CV]</a></center>
